\section{Testing round 1}

\subsection{Test description}
To make sure the product as a whole is working according to plan, testing must be done. First the components must be tested, this is done individually for each component to make sure there are no errors or fails when the product is built. The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the software units that are integrated together. Testing is also done to watch the behavior of the product and tweak it.

\subsection{Unit Testing}
TBD testing af individuelle dele
Sensor
Motor
H-Bro
PWM

\subsection{Integration Testing}
TBD testing af interfacet og evt samarbejde mellem enkelte dele
Interface
PWM - motor

\subsection{System Testing}
TBD testing af systemet som helhed
Sensor - motor

\subsection{Acceptance Testing}
TBD testing af systemet som helhed. Acceptabel ydeevne?
Kan den klare banen?
