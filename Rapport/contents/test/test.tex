\section{Testing round 1}

\subsection{Test description}
To make sure the product as a whole is working according to plan, testing must be done. First the components must be tested, this is done individually for each component to make sure there are no errors or fails when the product is built. The purpose of integration testing is to detect any inconsistencies between the software units that are integrated together. Testing is also done to watch the behavior of the product and tweak it.
