\subsection{OPB704 Sensor}
Sensor choice for the line following robot will be the OPB704. The choice was logical because of the availability. It was confirmed in the brainstorming process that the sensor was reliable and had a wide range of applications. 3D printing the mount was ideal for the purpose of the sensor and the task ahead.
