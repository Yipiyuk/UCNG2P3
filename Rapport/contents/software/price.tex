\section{Calculation of the price developing the software}
To develop the program for the microcontroller, we have estimated the man hours of making the program to be around 300-350 hours and the programmer will be paid 300 kr/h. For testing we have estimated that the tester will need around 150-200 hours and be paid 200kr/h.
\newline \newline
This will result in the calculated price:
$$\textbf{Work hours}*\textbf{Hourly salary}=\textbf{Price}$$
This gives a total estimated price for the development of the program:
$$350*300\textbf{kr}=105000\textbf{kr}$$
The total price for testing the devices is:
$$200*200\textbf{kr}=40000\textbf{kr}$$
To find the total cost, the individual estimates are added together:
$$105000\textbf{kr}+40000\textbf{kr}=145000\textbf{kr}$$
